LaTeX files for thesis, formatted according to 2018 requirements

Originally downloaded from UCDenver Anschutz Graduate School website in 2017 and modified to meet formatting requirements for early 2018 graduation.

This repository contains files for different sections of a thesis, and other auxiliary files needed for compiling. Chapters and such are provided as templates; formatting should be taken care of, but the actual writing is missing. Although all of these files were created from a fully-formatted (and accepted) thesis, they haven't been compiled in their current state. I hope that if there are problems in compiling, they will be fairly minor problems.
