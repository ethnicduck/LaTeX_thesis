% For the bibliography there are two options. (1) You can create a  master file
% called thesis.bib (template included in this % collection of files) and use
% the \bibliography{thesis}  command. The advantage is that thesis.bib can be
% used for other papers (2) You can create the file thesis_bib.tex which is a
% list of references specifically for this thesis.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Option 1 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\nocite{*} % forces all references to be printed.
%\bibliographystyle{plain}
%\bibliography{thesis}
