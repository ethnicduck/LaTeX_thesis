\section{Introduction} {
I'm leaving some text in here to show how sections are set up.
\section{Methods and Materials}{
\subsection{Subsection level}{
Blah Blah Blah
}
\subsection{Another subsection}{
This is all just nonsense 
}
\subsection{This is a redundant example of a subsection header}{
More garbage text
\\ %Infrequently, I had to insert these slashes to avoid widowed or orphaned text. I'm just leaving them here for you to see
\\
}
}
\section{Results}{
\subsection{Making Good progress now...} {

What is the meaning of life?

\insertfigure{Figures/Hello.jpg}{fig_name}{title}{This figure is an example of how to insert a figure. It should be on its own page because I find it easier to automatically put it by itself. } 

Here, I am giving an example of a citation\cite{ref1, ref2 }.
And here I am giving an example of a reference to a figure  (see Figure \ref{fig_name}). Tables work the same way (see Table \ref{table}).

\inserthfigure{Figures/Hello.jpg}{horizontal_figure}{Title of Figure }{This is just to show how to put in a figure on a landscape page. }
\insertscalefigure{Figures/Hello.jpg}{fig_name1}{Figure title}{Caption on a scaled figure} {16cm}
\inserttable{Tables/Example_table.tex}{table}{Title}{Caption}{1} %this last bracket can scale the table. Ex: 0.75 will make it three-quarters size

} 
}
\section{Discussion}{
Discuss here.

\section{Acknowledgements}{
If you have folks to acknowledge...
