As everyone knows, a row of dominoes, all standing on edge, will
undergo a chain reaction when the first domino is tipped. This
paper addresses the question of minimizing the total travel time
of the chain reaction in two situations: when the dominoes have
uniform spacing and when the dominoes may have arbitrary spacing.
The solution of these problems requires a combination of symbolic
calculations, in order to analyze the travel time in terms of
elliptic integrals, and numerical calculations, in order to solve
high-dimensional minimization problems.
